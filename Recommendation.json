Also both have a really killer (no pun intended lol) soundtrack and visuals and artstyle too. So if you liked the smt games or twewy then both should be up your alley. ^^",

A real similarity is the hidden message within the story, but I will not dabble on it since it would require spoilers similar to ergo proxy. Definitely check out this similar psychological and philosophical anime and see if it is worth the hype!",

Jijou wo Shiranai focuses on the gloomy girl realizing that she can have friends and be happy, despite her \"shinigami\" moniker. However, the relationship starts out a bit one-sided, since the main boy is incredibly earnest, but very oblivious with the affection he shows the main girl. Boku no Kokoro is more evenly balanced with a mutual progression of them both realizing their love for each other and the gloomy boy coming out of his shell. It's a slow burn, but there's a good amount of development in each interaction that continually builds up. Also, know that both anime are absolute diabetes for the heart, but that Boku no Kokoro can be a bit lewd near the beginning.",

Although, Bang dream gives us that essence of being in a band in a way of dream. Their dream to reach Budokan or reach higher peak, even if they don't show it. K-On is the opposite to that, it's not like they don't want to play in Budokan but it's chill version, it's moe is the cherry on top. They goof around and do their thing, play at their culture festival, etc. K-On is the slice of life and comedy version of bang dream, if you just wanna chill, I highly reccommend to you watching K-On worth the time and has a proper ending",

Bang dream has great music, especially I love their vocals (Yukina Minato and Kasumi Toyama). Bocchi the rock doesn't let us down either with its chaotic yet eye-catching way of portraying how bands vibe with each other, its slice of life genre is just an additional spice to its perfect dish.",

Kazuya is basically what are the things to avoid doing. What is interesting after watching both anime we can picture a alternative future of Chizuru becoming a celebrity and a better Kazuya a confident smarter guy that knows to have a healthy relationship.",

All of those themes are common in one and another. The protagonist are really passionate about their on areas of expertise and that make them really intriguing. Also, curiously, both of them have similar casts roles in the side characters roaster which made me baffled... I literally could see characters correspondences between the series (not point out that they are copycats, after all, their conjectures are different... differently context and locals - Kusuriya being apparently in Ancient China). If you like curious protagonists that seem to have every answer to their own respective fields of knowledge and, along the way, debating social roles and Information as power (most of time, presenting those topics implicitly), both anime are absolutely bangers.",

A fair warning Baccano is very difficult to find but i promise you that in any form you consume it in via light novel or anime it is well worth the hassel!",

Regardless they both also have some similar flaws. Like some really bad two dimensional characters or some gags being too forced. --- One big flaw of Nodame Cantabile is oddly the main female lead. The author uses her for comedy gags all the time, so you just don't really end up taking her character as a mature main lead specially when the main male lead is way more mature. It would have been great to add some depth to her character instead of being used as a comedy gag ragdoll all the time. Frankly, i could only take the female lead a bit seriously only if i just imagined that she is a bit on the autism spectrum. Ah and i have nothing against autistic people, in fact i consider them to be gifted. It's the eccentric behaviour. One really strong aspect of Nodame Cantabile is the concerts, if you have some attention span in your brain then you will get completely sucked into it, you'll get goosebumps. Even if you don't appreciate classical music. The anime does an exemptional job to make you feel like you're part of the audience too. --- On the other hand lovely complex does a fantastic job with the female lead character but the dense trope in the male lead feels forced at times. Otherwise some of the other side characters also have bad two dimensional tropes, to the point of being a bit annoying for viewers. The musical score in the anime is highly underrated, the orchestra hits you hard at the right timing in certain moments. --- Well both are a fun ride to watch if you have a soft spot for shoujo/romance genre. These are NOT seinen titles, so don't expect any serious psycchological/adult themes dumbass. It's all family friendly.",
